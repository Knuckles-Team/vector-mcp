# CONN-VECTOR-MCP-DATA-PLATFORM-OPERATIONS — Implementation plan

Governing spec: [spec.md](spec.md). Rows: [requirements.md](requirements.md).

## Summary

This plan states how `vector-mcp` delivers the rows of `CONN-VECTOR-MCP-DATA-PLATFORM-OPERATIONS`. The live caller is the `vector-mcp` console script. The owner is the `vector_mcp` package. The rows reuse the `scion-sdk` helpers and add no second authority. The plan changes no runtime code.

## Technical Context

- **Language/Version**: Python >=3.12
- **Primary Dependencies**: scion-sdk[mcp]>=0.6.4,<0.7.0; fastmcp; further pins in `pyproject.toml` (scion-sdk[mcp]>=0.6.4,<0.7.0, markdownify>=1.2.3, beautifulsoup4>=4.15.0, ebooklib>=0.20, html2text>=2025.4.15, ipython>=9.15.0)
- **Storage**: N/A, the connector keeps no store of its own
- **Testing**: pytest; each row names the proving test as `path::name`
- **Target Platform**: Linux container and stdio or streamable HTTP MCP clients
- **Project Type**: connector
- **Performance Goals**: N/A, the vendor service sets the latency
- **Constraints**: vendor calls go through the SDK governed client; no connector-local transport
- **Scale/Scope**: 1 active row(s) in this spec

## Constitution Check

- Organization constitution 1.5.0, spec-first change: pass. Every behaviour is a row of this spec with a bound or planned test.
- Repository article R-I, connector scope: pass. The rows stay inside this connector's one external system and reuse the SDK for shared capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `vector_mcp/mcp_server.py` (existing)
- `vector_mcp/vector_api.py` (existing)
- `tests/test_mcp_server.py` (existing)

## Phase 0: Research

No unknowns. Every row names its code and test; the caller chain of each row was read from the code.

## Phase 1: Design

### Phase 0: Research

No unknowns. Every row names its code and test; the caller chain of each row was read from the code.

### Phase 1: Design

### Existing system and reuse

The operation joins the existing tool surface in `vector_mcp/mcp_server.py`. It reuses the connector's client and auth.

### Architecture

One tool per API operation. Read-only. The connector returns typed data; medulla maps it.

### Interfaces and data model

A new MCP tool with a typed result. No migration.

### Live integration path

Client call, then the MCP tool in `vector_mcp/mcp_server.py`, then the backend API.

### Quality and release gates

The repo's pre-commit gates and the focused test named in the row.

### Risks, alternatives, and decisions

A backend without the capability returns a typed unsupported result.

### Phase 2: Task approach

`tasks.md` holds one task per row, producer first. Rows that depend on none run in parallel. A task is checked when its `Spec:` trailer is on the default branch.

### Complexity Tracking

None. The constitution check passed.

### Build contract

- `pre-commit run --all-files` runs ruff check, ruff format, the shared `connector-standard`, `spec`, `secrets` and `dependency-readiness` gates at the pinned shared revision.
- `uv run pytest tests` runs the proving tests; the shared complexity, duplication and KISS gates apply their org thresholds and this repository sets no local override.
- A change adds no scanner suppression and no duplicate implementation of an SDK helper.

### Production caller chain


### Cross-repo seams

None. The rows depend only on the published `scion-sdk` package, which the connector imports.

### Production caller chain

- `CONN-VECTOR-MCP-DATA-PLATFORM-OPERATIONS-R001`: an MCP client calls `vector_collection_management` (vector_mcp/mcp_server.py:176) with a new `stats` action, which calls `VectorAPI` in `vector_mcp/vector_api.py` to read the collection.
